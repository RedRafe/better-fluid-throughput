# BETTER FLUID THROUGHPUT

Compress all fluids by a factor of 10 to ease fluid handling, solve pipe throughput issues, and improve UPS.


> __This mod does not affect the game balance__, it's just a quality of life feature to help the game engine better handle fluid throughput,
> removes the need of using thousands of pipes/pumps to ensure correct flows, reducing number of entities/fluid boxes and improve UPS.

## Features

- can customize the compression factor from mod setting (range 1 - 1'000, *default: 10*)
- can choose to compress storage tanks and fluid wagons capacity by the same factor (*default: OFF*)

---

## What this mod does:
The game balance remain unchanged, while improving fluid throughput and handling:

- pipes/pumps/storages remain unchanged
- all fluids are compressed by a factor of 10, meaning:
  - recipes' fluids input/output are 1/10 
  - machines consume/produce 1/10 of fluids
  - fluids yield 10x fuel value and heat capacity (to balance the x10 compression)
  - 100 fluid/s is equivalent to 1'000 fluid/s, meaning 1 pipe can now handle the throughput of 10


## Compatibility
Should be compatible with every mod, unless strange modifications at the latter stage of prototypes definition.

Ad hoc compatibility with:
- **Space Exploration** --> excluding rocket/spaceship special fuels and tanks to maintain balance
- **Pressurized Fluids** --> handle migration to replace *Pressurized Fluids* in favor of *Better Fluid Throughput*
